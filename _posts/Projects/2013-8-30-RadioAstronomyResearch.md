### Background

I worked on this project with Jake Cohen during Summer 2013 under supervision of Professor Roberts while I was in the [Brandeis Radio Astronomy Group](http://pc.astro.brandeis.edu/).

### Abstract

X-Shaped Radio Galaxies are an anomalous, fascinating subset of radio galaxies due to their complex morphology. However, while there exist several explanations for the formation of these galaxies, insufficient research exists to provide a clear answer. The purpose of this project is to provide groundwork for a further study of X-shaped Radio Galaxies at radio wavelengths by studying potential X-shaped radio galaxies and creating higher resolution contour maps. These maps will help to determine the merit for the further study of the galaxies.
