###Why build this blog

Actually, I had a github page before but didn't use it very often. Today, I decide to start my blogging and completely change the theme of my old github page. I have deleted all previous posts and hope to share with you more excellent articles in the future.

<a name="What am I going to do"/>

### What am I going to do

* Share my ideas on how to approach some coding problems from LeetCode or CC150

* Present some of my previous projects(JavaWeb, Networking, Machine Learning, etc)

* Machine Learning and Data Science techniques from what I learn

* Some self-learning logs

* And more...
