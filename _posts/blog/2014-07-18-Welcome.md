## Welcome to ScienceBank

### About the blog
As you can see, now I seperate my blog into three parts:

* Blogs: daily posts, opinions, study blogs in science...
* Coding_Problems: my solutions of cc150, leetcode, project Euler...
Currently, this part only contains codes but I will re-orgnize them shortly and add my thoughs of solving the problems
* Project: descriptions of projects, ideas, designs...

### About me
Find more about me by the following links:

* [My LinkedIn][2]
* [My personal website][3]
* [My resume][4]
* [My Github][5]


### My Plan

* I am studying JavaWeb by myself recently, so I am going to post some study blogs and
discuss about some projects that I have completed. I am a new learner in web development 
and I don't have any experience before. I hope my blogs can help people like me have a better
first step into web development

* In the meantime, I will try my best to keep up with practing interview coding problems.
Welcome any comments about my solutions and I will update solutions once I come up with a new idea

* I will share other interesting stuff, but I don't know for now....

### Ending
I name my blog as **ScienceBank** because I passionate about future and technology's influence on it.
I hope **ScienceBank** will be a place full of scientific assets.
